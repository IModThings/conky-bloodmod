Conky Seamod theme
====================

Seamod theme was built by SeaJey. I modified maxiwell's updated version to make it fit with my theme. I also threw in my desktop picture which I made in blender specifically to go with this conky.

Changes:
--------------
Increased width
set all orange/green colors to red
Added title bar to top with manually set text.
Changed to dual core cpu
Changed vertical spacing of stuff
