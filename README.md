Conky Huemod theme
====================

The Seamod theme was built by SeaJey. I modified maxiwell's updated version to make it fit with my laptop's theme. I also threw in my desktop pictures which I made in blender specifically to go with this conky. I Like all three of these color schemes and have it scripted to automatically rotate every day.

Changes from Maxiwell's version:
--------------
Increased width
Set custom colors
Added title bar to top with manually set text.
Changed to dual core cpu
Changed vertical spacing of stuff
Made desktop pics to go with them
